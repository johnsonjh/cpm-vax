Greetings!

This is a utility that allows CP/M disk images to be manipulated under
Unix. It supports disk images in either the standard 8" SSSD format or
the P112 3.5" format. Disk images can be examined and files imported and
exported from them.

The source is a slightly hacked over copy of CP/M-68K which has 
been worked over to allow compilation using GCC, to wit:

     - A handful of typecasts have been dropped in.
     - An assumption that an int is 16 bits has been fixed.
     - An assumption that chars are signed has been fixed.
     - The file diverge.h renames all of the globals to ensure they
       don't collide with operating system globals.
     - I changed the way the BDOS communicates with the BIOS; see
       biosdef.h
     - There are probably a couple of other minor changes I made that
       I've forgotten (perhaps renaming a routine or two before I
       decided to make diverge.h).
     - A BIOS that allows the program to be run under Unix.

I've also added a couple of built-in commands:

     - EXIT causes CP/M-68K to exit, returning to the host operating
       system.
     - IMPORT copies a file from the current directory of the host
       operating system into the disk image.
     - EXPORT copies a file from the disk image into the current
       directory of the host operating system.

IMPORT and EXPORT do not accept wildcards. This is just a quickie hack
that turned out to be useful, not a snazzy disk image manipulation
program.

To build the program, execute make. This results in an executable called
exchange. The command-line syntax is:

     exchange [-p112] file.img

     -p112     This option tells the file to use the P112 3.5" disk format
               for the image. By default, the the standard 8" SSSD format is 
               used.

     file.img  is the name of the disk image that should be used.

In this example, I copy the file BDOS.LST from an 8" SSSD image
containing CP/M 1.4 sources (obtained from http://cpm.z80.de/) to user 1
of the P112 boot disk image (obtained from 
http://members.iinet.net.au/~daveb/p112/p112.html):

> export BDOS    .LST -> BDOS.LST
> A>exit
> mac> ls
> BDOS.LST  bdosPLM.img  bootdisk.img  exchange

> 1A>dir
> A: RECEIVE  PAS : UUENCODE PAS : UUDECODE PAS : USER     MAC : ROM    UUE
